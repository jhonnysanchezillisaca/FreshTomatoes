# Fresh Tomatoes!

Fresh Tomatoes! is a Movie Trailer Website where users can see a list of movies and watch the trailers.

## Dependencies

Fresh Tomatoes! uses the HTTP library for Python [Requests](http://python-requests.org).

To install Requests, simply run this simple command in your terminal of choice:

```
$ pip install requests
```

## Installation

To generate the Website you need to download the files and run the program `entertainment_center.py`:
```
$ python entertainment_center.py

The program generates the Movie Trailer Website, a html file `fresh_tomatoes.html` and opens it automatically.
